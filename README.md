# YADL (Yet Another DOM Library)

yadl is a tiny DOM library, created specifically for my Visual HTML editor. The intent is to have a simple method of manipulating the DOM, with hooks on all DOM updates. I like chain syntax (d3, for example), so that's what we're doing here.

# Use

`npm install @tbrink/yadl`

# YADL (Yet Another DOM Library)

yadl is a tiny DOM library, created specifically for my Visual HTML editor. The intent is to have a simple method of manipulating the DOM, with hooks on all DOM updates. I like chain syntax (d3, for example), so that's what we're doing here.

# Use

Right now if you want to use this you will have to clone the source and build the library from source (npm run build)
